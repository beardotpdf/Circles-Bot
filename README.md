This is a twitter bot, comprised of a few python scripts, the goal is to produce so much artwork that I find some gems. To create such a collection that I am engulfed by the vastness of a cohesive visual project
The files have a couple different tasks, they produce the images and save the files locally, as well as updating the .txt file that stores all the file names.
The other python file is the script that handles triggering the image creation script followed by posting the images to twitter.
I will hopefully have this working shortly

Finding a reasonable number to assign the value of total permutations too is difficult, I believe the absolute minimum to be around 80,000,000,000
